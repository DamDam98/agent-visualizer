# Memory Management Agent - Feature Planning

**Goal**: Implement a memory management system that allows our research agent to store, organize, and leverage research findings across multiple search operations.

**Vision**: Create a hybrid architecture where search operations automatically store findings in structured documents, enabling the agent to build knowledge progressively and avoid redundant searches.

---

## Core Architecture Concept

### Hybrid Memory System:

1. **Memory Agent Tool** - Dedicated document management with CRUD operations
2. **Enhanced Search Tool** - Automatically calls memory agent after each search
3. **Smart Context Management** - Reasoner gets all documents + recent messages (10 most recent) + summary of older messages (summary of previous 5 messages, summary of 10 before that, summary of 15 before that, summary of 20 before that... etc)
4. **Open/Closed Questions Tracking** - Track research progress and avoid redundancy

### Flow Pattern:

```
User Query → Reasoner (sees docs) → Search Tool → Memory Agent (stores findings) → Reasoner (updated context)
```

---

## Document Structure (Proposed)

```python
current_research_document = {
    "topic": "Gaming Revenue Analysis 2024",
    "created": "2024-01-15T10:00:00",
    "findings": [
        "Gaming industry estimated at $200B globally in 2024",
        "Fortnite revenue estimated between $1-2B (no official figures)",
        "Mobile gaming represents 50% of total market"
    ],
    "open_questions": [
        "What is Fortnite's exact 2024 revenue?",
        "What percentage do top 3 games represent?"
    ],
    "closed_questions": [
        {
            "question": "What is the total gaming market size?",
            "answer": "Approximately $200 billion globally in 2024",
            "source": "Multiple industry reports"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Memory Agent Tool Operations

### Document Management

```python
@tool
def memory_create_document(topic: str, main_question: str) -> str:
    """Create new research document with initial research question"""

@tool
def memory_add_finding(doc_id: str, content: str, source: str, confidence: str = "medium") -> str:
    """Append new finding to document with source attribution"""

@tool
def memory_add_open_question(doc_id: str, question: str) -> str:
    """Add new question to open questions list"""
```

### Question Lifecycle Management

#### Complete Answer Closure

```python
@tool
def memory_close_question_complete(doc_id: str, question: str, answer: str, evidence: List[str], confidence: str) -> str:
    """Close question with definitive answer and supporting evidence"""
```

#### Partial/Approximation Closure

```python
@tool
def memory_close_question_partial(doc_id: str, question: str, partial_answer: str, available_evidence: List[str], limitations: str, approximation_method: str) -> str:
    """Close question with best available approximation when complete data unavailable

    Args:
        question: The original question
        partial_answer: Best approximation or partial answer available
        available_evidence: What evidence we do have
        limitations: What information was missing/unavailable
        approximation_method: How the approximation was derived (e.g., 'industry averages', 'comparable estimates')
    """
```

#### Question Status Updates

```python
@tool
def memory_update_question_evidence(doc_id: str, question: str, new_evidence: str) -> str:
    """Add additional evidence to existing question (open or closed)"""

@tool
def memory_reopen_question(doc_id: str, question: str, reason: str) -> str:
    """Move closed question back to open with explanation"""
```

### Smart Document Operations

#### Content Intelligence

```python
@tool
def memory_merge_findings(doc_id: str, finding_ids: List[str], merged_summary: str) -> str:
    """Combine related findings into coherent summary"""

@tool
def memory_detect_question_answers(doc_id: str) -> str:
    """Analyze recent findings to identify potential answers to open questions"""

@tool
def memory_reflect_on_document(doc_id: str, focus: str) -> str:
    """Use reflection to analyze document and derive insights
    Can internally call reflection_tool for deep analysis"""
```

#### Document Queries

```python
@tool
def memory_search_documents(query: str) -> str:
    """Find relevant documents/findings across all research"""

@tool
def memory_get_document_summary(doc_id: str, include_closed: bool = True) -> str:
    """Get concise summary of document status and key findings"""

@tool
def memory_list_documents() -> str:
    """List all research documents with brief summaries"""
```

---

## Question Lifecycle States

### Open Question

```python
{
    "question": "What is Fortnite's exact 2024 revenue?",
    "status": "open",
    "added": "2024-01-15T10:00:00",
    "search_attempts": ["fortnite revenue 2024", "epic games financial report"],
    "partial_evidence": ["Industry estimates range $1-2B", "No official figures disclosed"]
}
```

### Closed Question - Complete Answer

```python
{
    "question": "What is the total gaming market size?",
    "status": "closed_complete",
    "answer": "Approximately $200 billion globally in 2024",
    "evidence": ["Multiple industry reports confirm $200B", "Statista gaming market analysis"],
    "confidence": "high",
    "closed": "2024-01-15T10:15:00"
}
```

### Closed Question - Partial/Approximation

```python
{
    "question": "What is Fortnite's exact 2024 revenue?",
    "status": "closed_partial",
    "partial_answer": "Estimated $1.5 billion based on industry analysis",
    "available_evidence": [
        "Epic Games doesn't disclose exact figures",
        "Industry analysts estimate $1-2B range",
        "Fortnite remains top earner in battle royale genre"
    ],
    "limitations": "Official revenue figures not publicly disclosed by Epic Games",
    "approximation_method": "Industry analyst estimates and market position analysis",
    "confidence": "medium",
    "closed": "2024-01-15T10:25:00"
}
```

---

## Smart Context Management

### Message Summary Strategy

- **10 most recent messages** (full detail)
- **Summary of previous 5 messages**
- **Summary of 10 before that**
- **Summary of 15 before that**
- **etc.**

### Summary Generation Tools

```python
@tool
def generate_message_summary(messages: List[str], summary_type: str) -> str:
    """Generate intelligent summary of message batch

    Args:
        messages: List of message contents to summarize
        summary_type: 'research_progress', 'tool_usage', 'findings_only'
    """
```

---

## Architecture Principles

### Memory Agent as "Document Librarian"

- **Smart but instruction-based** - takes explicit commands from reasoner
- **Incremental operations only** - never rewrites full JSON documents
- **Can access reflection_tool** for document analysis when requested
- **Suggests operations** but doesn't auto-execute major changes
- **Handles partial information gracefully** - approximations are valid research outcomes

### Question Closure Philosophy

- **Complete closure** when definitive answers found
- **Partial closure** when reasonable approximations possible
- **Honest limitations** - clearly document what wasn't available
- **Approximation transparency** - explain how estimates were derived
- **Professional research standards** - partial answers with caveats are valuable

---

## Notes & Insights

- **DeepResearch Pattern**: Hierarchical agents with specialized document storage
- **Append-Only Design**: Never delete findings, only add and update
- **Transparency**: All memory operations should be visible in LangSmith traces
- **Demo Value**: Memory system shows progressive knowledge building
- **Partial Information Handling**: Professional research includes honest limitations and reasonable approximations

---

## UPDATED APPROACH - Simplified for Demo (2024-01-15)

### Key Simplifications Made:

After exploring the complex architecture above, we've decided to simplify for demo purposes:

1. **Drop Chat Summarization** - Skip message summarization as an optimization for later
2. **Singular Document** - One research document per conversation, not multiple documents
3. **Memory Agent with Reasoner/Executor** - Keep the clear tracing pattern like main agent
4. **Auto-triggered Memory** - Every search automatically triggers memory agent
5. **Direct Integration** - Main reasoner pulls in current document every time (no summarization needed)

### Simplified Requirements:

- **One document per conversation** - Simple scope
- **Memory agent has reasoner/executor nodes** - For LangGraph Studio visibility
- **Search integration** - Every search auto-calls memory agent
- **Main reasoner integration** - Gets full document each time
- **Direct memory access** - Main reasoner can set up research directly

### Simplified Tool API:

```python
@tool
def memory_setup_research(topic: str, initial_questions: List[str]) -> str:
    """Initialize research document - called by main reasoner at start"""

@tool
def memory_add_finding(content: str, source: str) -> str:
    """Add finding - auto-triggered after every search"""

@tool
def memory_add_question(question: str) -> str:
    """Add new question to investigate"""

@tool
def memory_answer_question(question: str, answer: str, source: str) -> str:
    """Mark question as answered"""

@tool
def memory_get_current_research() -> str:
    """Get complete research document - used by main reasoner"""
```

### Simple Document Structure:

```python
current_research_document = {
    "topic": "Gaming Revenue Analysis 2024",
    "findings": ["Finding 1", "Finding 2"],
    "open_questions": ["Question 1", "Question 2"],
    "closed_questions": [{"q": "Question", "a": "Answer", "source": "Source"}]
}
```

This keeps the demo manageable while still showcasing the core memory concept!

---

## REFINED TOOL SELECTION (2024-01-15)

### Selected Tools from Original Exploration:

After reviewing all the tools we explored, here are the ones that provide the best demo value:

```python
@tool
def memory_create_document(topic: str, main_question: str) -> str:
    """Create new research document with initial research question"""

@tool
def memory_add_finding(content: str, source: str, confidence: str, related_questions: List[str]) -> str:
    """Add finding with source, confidence, and link to specific research questions

    Args:
        content: The finding/discovery
        source: Where this came from (search_tool, data_analysis_tool, etc.)
        confidence: high/medium/low confidence in this finding
        related_questions: Which research questions this finding helps answer
    """

@tool
def memory_add_open_question(question: str) -> str:
    """Add new question to investigate"""

@tool
def memory_close_question_complete(question: str, answer: str, evidence: List[str], confidence: str) -> str:
    """Close question with definitive answer and supporting evidence"""

@tool
def memory_close_question_partial(question: str, partial_answer: str, available_evidence: List[str], limitations: str, approximation_method: str) -> str:
    """Close question with best available approximation when complete data unavailable"""
```

### Enhanced Document Structure with Question-Finding Links:

```python
current_research_document = {
    "topic": "Gaming Revenue Analysis 2024",
    "main_question": "What are the top 3 highest-grossing video games of 2024?",
    "created": "2024-01-15T10:00:00",
    "findings": [
        {
            "content": "Gaming industry estimated at $200B globally in 2024",
            "source": "search_tool",
            "confidence": "high",
            "related_questions": ["What is the total gaming market size?"],
            "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:05:00"
        },
        {
            "content": "Fortnite revenue estimated between $1-2B (no official figures)",
            "source": "search_tool",
            "confidence": "medium",
            "related_questions": ["What is Fortnite's exact 2024 revenue?"],
            "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:07:00"
        }
    ],
    "open_questions": [
        "What is Fortnite's exact 2024 revenue?",
        "What percentage do top 3 games represent?"
    ],
    "closed_questions": [
        {
            "question": "What is the total gaming market size?",
            "status": "closed_complete",
            "answer": "Approximately $200 billion globally in 2024",
            "evidence": ["Multiple industry reports", "Statista analysis"],
            "confidence": "high",
            "closed": "2024-01-15T10:15:00"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Benefits of Question-Finding Links:

- **Traceability** - Can see which findings support which questions
- **Smart Question Closure** - Memory agent can detect when enough evidence exists
- **Organized Research** - Findings are connected to specific research goals
- **Demo Value** - Shows intelligent knowledge organization
- **Realistic Research** - Questions can have limitations/unsolved gaps, which is normal

## TOOL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS (2024-01-15)

### 1. `memory_create_document(topic: str, main_question: str)`

**JSON Operations:**

- Initialize new document structure in `research_document` state
- Set `topic`, `main_question`, `created` timestamp
- Initialize empty arrays: `findings`, `open_questions`, `closed_questions`

**Requirements:**

- Must be called first before other memory operations
- Creates the base structure for all subsequent operations

### 2. `memory_add_finding(content: str, source: str, confidence: str, related_questions: List[str])`

**JSON Operations:**

- Append new finding object to `findings` array
- Include: `content`, `source`, `confidence`, `related_questions`, `timestamp`
- No modification of existing findings (append-only)

**Requirements:**

- Auto-triggered after every search operation
- Must validate that `related_questions` exist in open or closed questions
- Confidence must be: "high", "medium", or "low"

### 3. `memory_add_open_question(question: str)`

**JSON Operations:**

- Append question string to `open_questions` array
- Check for duplicates (don't add if already exists)

**Requirements:**

- Can be called by main reasoner to add new research directions
- Should validate question isn't already in closed_questions

### 4. `memory_close_question_complete(question: str, answer: str, evidence: List[str], confidence: str)`

**JSON Operations:**

- Remove question from `open_questions` array
- Add new object to `closed_questions` array with:
  - `question`, `status: "closed_complete"`, `answer`, `evidence`, `confidence`, `closed` timestamp

**Requirements:**

- Must validate question exists in open_questions
- Evidence should reference related findings
- Confidence: "high", "medium", "low"

### 5. `memory_close_question_partial(question: str, partial_answer: str, available_evidence: List[str], limitations: str, approximation_method: str)`

**JSON Operations:**

- Remove question from `open_questions` array
- Add new object to `closed_questions` array with:
  - `question`, `status: "closed_partial"`, `partial_answer`, `available_evidence`, `limitations`, `approximation_method`, `confidence: "medium"`, `closed` timestamp

**Requirements:**

- Must validate question exists in open_questions
- Limitations field captures what couldn't be determined
- Approximation_method explains how estimate was derived

### AgentState Update Required:

```python
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages]
    research_document: dict  # New field for memory storage
```

### Error Handling:

- All tools should return success/error messages
- Validate document exists before operations (except create)
- Handle duplicate questions gracefully
- Provide clear feedback for demo tracing

---

## FINAL REFINEMENT - Auto Document Creation (2024-01-15)

### Remove `memory_create_document` Tool:

Instead of requiring explicit document creation, use **lazy initialization**:

- **Any memory tool** can be called first
- **If no document exists**, automatically create one with:
  - `topic`: Derived from first operation or generic "Research Session"
  - `main_question`: Derived from context or first question added
  - `created`: Current timestamp

### Updated Tool List (4 tools):

```python
@tool
def memory_add_finding(content: str, source: str, confidence: str, related_questions: List[str]) -> str:
    """Add finding - auto-creates document if none exists"""

@tool
def memory_add_open_question(question: str) -> str:
    """Add question - auto-creates document if none exists"""

@tool
def memory_close_question_complete(question: str, answer: str, evidence: List[str], confidence: str) -> str:
    """Close question with complete answer"""

@tool
def memory_close_question_partial(question: str, partial_answer: str, available_evidence: List[str], limitations: str, approximation_method: str) -> str:
    """Close question with partial answer"""
```

### Implementation Logic:

```python
def ensure_document_exists(state):
    """Create document if it doesn't exist"""
    if not state.get("research_document"):
        state["research_document"] = {
            "topic": "Research Session",
            "created": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "findings": [],
            "open_questions": [],
            "closed_questions": []
        }
```

### Benefits:

- **Simpler API** - 4 tools instead of 5
- **No required initialization** - just start using memory
- **More natural flow** - document appears when needed
- **Less cognitive overhead** - one less thing to remember

---

## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY (2024-01-15)

### Main Orchestrator → Memory Agent Communication:

The main orchestrator/reasoner can **directly call the memory agent** (not individual memory tools):

- **Memory agent has its own reasoner/executor pattern** - like the main agent
- **Main orchestrator requests memory operations** - "Add these initial questions", "Close this question", etc.
- **Memory agent decides how to execute** - through its own reasoning process

### Typical Research Flow:

```
1. User Query: "What are the top 3 highest-grossing games of 2024?"

2. Main Reasoner → Memory Agent:
   "Set up research with questions: Fortnite revenue, Minecraft revenue, Roblox revenue"
   [Memory agent creates document and adds open questions]

3. Main Reasoner → Search Tool: "Search for Fortnite revenue 2024"
   Search Tool → Memory Agent: "Add this finding about Fortnite"
   [Memory agent processes and stores the finding]

4. Main Reasoner → Reflection Tool: "Analyze what we know so far"
   Reflection Tool → Memory Agent: "I think we can close the Fortnite question with partial answer"
   [Memory agent evaluates and potentially closes the question]

5. Main Reasoner → Memory Agent: "What's our current research status?"
   [Memory agent provides summary of open/closed questions]
```

### Agent-to-Agent Communication:

- **Main Reasoner ↔ Memory Agent**: Strategic research planning and status updates
- **Search Tool → Memory Agent**: Automatic finding storage after searches
- **Reflection Tool → Memory Agent**: Evidence analysis and question closure suggestions
- **Memory Agent**: Processes all requests through its own reasoner/executor nodes

### Demo Value:

- **Clear agent separation** - Each agent has distinct responsibilities
- **Agent collaboration** - Agents communicate and coordinate through memory
- **Visible reasoning** - Memory agent's reasoning process visible in LangGraph Studio

### Testing Philosophy:

- **Test immediately after each step** - Don't move forward until current step works
- **Incremental validation** - Each step builds on verified previous steps
- **Catch issues early** - Problems are easier to debug in isolation
- **Document what works** - Keep notes on what's been validated

## STATUS UPDATE - Step 1 Complete

**✅ Foundation Setup Complete (Steps 1-3)**

- Added `research_document: dict` field to AgentState
- Implemented `ensure_document_exists(state, topic=None)` with smart topic handling
- Simplified topic logic: explicit topic parameter or "Research Session" default
- Agent initializes without errors, document structure verified

**🎯 Next: Implement `memory_add_finding()` tool (Step 4)**

---

## STATUS UPDATE - Memory Agent Architecture Complete

**✅ Steps 4-5 Complete: First Memory Tool + Architecture**

- Implemented `memory_add_open_question_impl()` with full state manipulation
- Added duplicate detection and validation logic
- Built Memory Agent Reasoner node with intelligent analysis prompts
- Built Memory Agent Executor node with **multi-tool call capability**
- Memory agent can process complex requests like "Here are 8 questions" and break into multiple tool calls
- Added comprehensive testing for both individual tools and full agent flow

**🔧 Key Architecture Features:**

- **Reasoner**: Analyzes requests and decides what memory operations to perform
- **Executor**: Can make multiple tool calls in one turn (unlike main orchestrator)
- **State Access**: Memory tools directly modify `research_document` in agent state
- **Intelligent Prompts**: Context-aware prompts with document status and request analysis

**🎯 Next: Test memory agent in isolation, then integrate with main orchestrator**

---

## STATUS UPDATE - LangGraph Integration Complete

**✅ Memory Agent LangGraph Integration**

- Added `memory_agent_reasoner` and `memory_agent_executor` as proper LangGraph nodes
- Updated routing logic in `should_continue()` to detect `CALL_MEMORY_AGENT:` pattern
- Main reasoner can now request memory operations via special syntax
- Memory agent flow: `memory_agent_reasoner` → `memory_agent_executor` → back to `research_agent_reasoner`
- Proper LangGraph visualization will show memory agent as separate nodes in the graph

**🔧 LangGraph Flow Pattern:**

1. **User Query** → `research_agent_reasoner`
2. **Reasoner decides**: "CALL_MEMORY_AGENT: Log these questions..."
3. **Router detects pattern** → transitions to `memory_agent_reasoner`
4. **Memory reasoner** analyzes what memory operations needed
5. **Memory executor** performs multiple tool calls (add questions)
6. **Flow returns** to `research_agent_reasoner` to continue research

**🎯 Next: Test the full LangGraph flow with user's interim test case**

---

## STATUS UPDATE - Major Cleanup & Consolidation Complete

**✅ Memory System Cleanup & Standardization**

**🧹 Simplified Document Creation:**

- Removed complex topic/timestamp logic - now just simple default structure
- `ensure_document_exists()` creates: `{"findings": [], "open_questions": [], "closed_questions": []}`
- Document always exists - no more topic or created timestamp needed

**🔧 Standardized Tool Patterns:**

- Memory tools now follow same pattern as other tools (placeholder + custom node)
- Added `memory_tool_node` that handles state manipulation like other tool nodes
- Dynamic tool descriptions in memory reasoner (like main reasoner)
- Consistent routing through `should_continue()` function

**📊 LangGraph Integration:**

- Added `memory_tool` node to graph
- Memory executor can call tools → routes to `memory_tool` → back to main reasoner
- Clean flow: `memory_agent_executor` → `memory_tool` → `research_agent_reasoner`
- All tools follow same pattern for visualization

**🎯 Next: Test the consolidated system with user's gaming revenue test case**

## STATUS UPDATE - Architecture Refactoring Complete

**✅ Deep Audit & Refactoring for Memory Agent Preparation**

**🏗️ Key Architectural Improvements:**

1. **Clear Naming Convention:**

   - `orchestrator_*` prefix for main research agent components
   - `all_orchestrator_tools` instead of generic `all_tools`
   - `orchestrator_reasoner_node` / `orchestrator_executor_node`
   - `orchestrator_llm_with_tools` for clarity

2. **Organized Code Structure:**

   - Clear sections with dividers: `ORCHESTRATOR AGENT TOOLS & NODES`
   - `ORCHESTRATOR AGENT NODES` section
   - `GRAPH SETUP & ROUTING` section
   - Ready for `MEMORY AGENT` sections to be added

3. **State Initialization:**

   - Added `research_document: dict` to `AgentState`
   - Test initializes with empty document: `{"findings": [], "open_questions": [], "closed_questions": []}`
   - No conditional document creation - always exists from start

4. **Reusable Patterns Identified:**
   - Tool organization: `[tool_name]_tools = [tool]` arrays
   - Tool nodes: `ToolNode([tool_array])`
   - Agent nodes: reasoner + executor pattern
   - LLM binding: `llm.bind_tools(tool_array)`
   - Graph routing: `should_continue()` function

**🎯 Ready for Memory Agent Addition:**
The architecture is now clean and explicitly shows what belongs to orchestrator vs what will be memory agent. We can now add memory tools and memory agent using the exact same patterns.

**🎯 Next: Add memory tools using established patterns**

   {
     "content": "NYC population is 8.3 million",
     "source": "search_tool",
     "confidence": "high",
     "related_questions": ["What is the population of NYC?"],
     "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00"
   }
   ```

2. **Open Question:** Simple string format

   ```json
   "What is the population of NYC?"
   ```

3. **Closed Question Object:**
   ```json
   {
     "question": "What is the population of NYC?",
     "status": "closed_complete",
     "answer": "8.3 million people",
     "evidence": ["Search result from census data"],
     "confidence": "high",
     "closed": "2024-01-01T12:00:00"
   }
   ```

```python
@traceable
def initialization_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Initialize the agent state with proper research document structure"""

    if not state.get("research_document") or not state["research_document"]:
        print("📋 Initializing research document...")
        return {
            "research_document": create_empty_research_document()
        }

    print(f"📋 Research document already initialized...")
    return {}
```

**🌊 Graph Flow Updated:**

- `START` → `initialization` → `orchestrator_reasoner` → `orchestrator_executor` → tools...
- Research document automatically initialized on every graph run
- Works in LangGraph Studio, LangSmith, and test functions
- No manual state setup required

**✅ Benefits:**

- **LangGraph Studio Compatible**: Document initialized automatically when running in studio
- **LangSmith Tracing**: Initialization shows up as a traceable node in traces
- **Consistent State**: Every graph execution starts with proper document structure
- **Visual in Graph**: Initialization node appears in LangGraph visualization
- **No Manual Setup**: Test functions don't need to manually create research document

**🎯 Next: Add memory tools using established patterns - initialization is ready!**

## NEXT STINT OF WORK - Memory Agent Implementation

### **📋 Refined Requirements & Decisions:**

**✅ Architecture Decisions:**

- **Naming**: Memory Agent + Memory Operations (Option 3)
- **Routing**: Rename `should_continue()` → `orchestrator_should_continue()`
- **Memory Flow**: Simple pipeline (no self-looping, no should_continue needed)
- **Tool Integration**: Memory agent called via `trigger_memory_subagent_tool()` (clearer name!)
- **LLM Separation**: Memory agent needs its own LLM with memory operations bound

### **🎯 Implementation Scope:**

**1. Rename & Clean Current Architecture**

- Rename `should_continue()` → `orchestrator_should_continue()`
- Update graph to use new routing function name

**2. Add Memory Operations (Tools)**

- `memory_add_open_question()` - add research questions
- `memory_operations = [memory_add_open_question]` array
- Follow exact same pattern as orchestrator tools

**3. Add Memory Agent Architecture**

- `memory_agent_reasoner_node()` - decides what memory operations to perform
- `memory_agent_executor_node()` - executes memory operations
- `memory_operations_tool_node = ToolNode(memory_operations)` - handles actual operations
- **Separate LLM**: `memory_agent_llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(memory_operations)`

**4. Add Memory Agent Tool (Orchestrator → Memory)**

- `trigger_memory_subagent_tool(request: str)` - orchestrator calls this (clearer naming!)
- This tool triggers the memory agent pipeline
- Add to orchestrator tools list

**5. Graph Integration**

- Add memory agent nodes to graph
- Add memory operations tool node to graph
- Update orchestrator routing to handle `trigger_memory_subagent_tool` calls
- Set up memory agent pipeline flow (simple, no looping)

**6. Atomic Test**

- Test: orchestrator calls `trigger_memory_subagent_tool` to log questions
- Verify questions stored in research document
- Confirm flow works in LangGraph Studio

**🎯 Ready to start with Step 1 - renaming for clarity**
